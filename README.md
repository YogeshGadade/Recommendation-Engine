# Recommendation-Engine
Number of Algorithms that we can use in the Recommendation Engine

1. Apriori Algorithm: If product A is frequently purchased product and we found that many customer also purchased A and B together then we can recommend B to increase its sell.
2. Product list user is recently interested in: If user recently looking/visiting some list of products and spending some time on it then based on the time spent computing list of products that he/she is realy interested in.
3. Finding Similar Users. If User A is similar to B then if B buys xyz then we can recommend that product to A.
